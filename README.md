# quake

The quake repository contains the code for "Haptics Playground", an Android app that allows users to experiment with
haptic vibration patterns. Simple and complex patterns can be created, played, saved for later used, and exported in
JSON format.

Please see the documentation in the `doc` directory for information on how to set up the development environment for
this app.
